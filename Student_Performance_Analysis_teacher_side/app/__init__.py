"""Application factory.

Mirrors what the original app.py did at module load time: create the
`schooldb` database if it doesn't exist, configure Flask + SQLAlchemy,
set up logging, and wire up the routes - just split into steps so
routes/models/services can be organized into separate files (per
outline.txt) instead of one giant file.
